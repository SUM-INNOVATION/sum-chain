//! BR1 randomness-beacon (#125) execution seam — GATE-CLOSED, FAIL-CLOSED to #127.
//!
//! Owner OPTION B (2026-07) registered the beacon families in the canonical
//! `TxType`/`TxPayload` (`TxType::BeaconSetup` = 28, `TxType::BeaconSigning` = 29;
//! payload = [`sumchain_primitives::BeaconTxData`] wrapping a frozen
//! [`BeaconOperation`] encoding). **Registration authorizes DECODING, not
//! EXECUTION.** This module is the block-application acceptance seam and it is
//! deliberately closed:
//!
//! 1. **Gate-closed (the default) → deterministic free rejection.** The
//!    `beacon_enabled_from_height` activation gate is `None` by default and is
//!    fail-closed in `ChainParams::validate` (it can only be `Some(_)` for an
//!    isolated in-memory `ChainParams`, never through the authoritative genesis
//!    loader, until `BeaconParams`/#127 exists). While closed, [`execute`] returns
//!    the executor's **generic** failure receipt (`Failed(0)`, reused — see
//!    [`BEACON_GENERIC_FAILURE`]) with `fee_paid: 0` and mutates **no** state —
//!    exactly the dormant-deploy semantics of the other `*_enabled_from_height`
//!    gates (Supply, contracts, V2, …). The specific reason is the TYPED
//!    [`BeaconReject`], never a frozen receipt number.
//!
//! 2. **Gate-open → pure semantic precheck, then FAIL CLOSED for #127.** If a test
//!    (or a future activated chain) opens the gate, [`execute`] runs the pure,
//!    crypto-free semantic checks that are available now — payload decode, the
//!    phase↔variant consistency, the `chain_id` binding, and the finalize
//!    witness's structural canonicality (strictly ascending ⇒ sorted + distinct) —
//!    and then **fails closed** (still the generic `Failed(0)`,
//!    [`BeaconReject::CryptoUnavailablePending127`]) because the crypto and
//!    threshold/membership validation that MUST pass before any beacon state is
//!    accepted is not built yet. It never accepts unvalidated state. **No
//!    beacon-specific consensus receipt code is invented or frozen** (Option B
//!    ratified carrier schemas + tx ordinals, not receipt codes).
//!
//! ## Validation deferred to #127 (documented seam — MUST run before acceptance)
//!
//! The following are **NOT** performed here and are the reason the gate-open path
//! fails closed. They require the #127 crypto adapter (`blst`/`arkworks`) and/or a
//! `BeaconParams` + membership-snapshot runtime that do not exist:
//!
//! * BLS12-381 prime-order-subgroup + infinity membership for every G1/G2 field;
//! * `PopVerify` for `RegisterBeaconKeyV1.pop`;
//! * DLEQ (`DkgComplaintV1`) and AEAD/KDF open (`DkgDealV1.ct_ij`) adjudication;
//! * partial-signature and combined-signature pairing verification;
//! * the finalize witness being **exactly the active threshold `T`** and every
//!   index being a **valid membership index** for the epoch (needs `BeaconParams.T`
//!   + the epoch membership snapshot);
//! * key-registration binding to the registered validator identity / epoch window.
//!
//! When #127 lands, its adapter is invoked here (after the pure precheck) and only
//! on full success may beacon state be mutated; until then this seam rejects.
